# Portfolio Challenge: Practice Advanced CSS

## Description

This is the Advanced CSS challenge for my bootcamp. The goal is to create a responsive portfolio using CSS so that when I view the webpage from any device, it can stay as readable and accessible as possible.

The page has such features as links to sections of different parts of the document, buttons with images that people can click on and send them to further reading, and a contact info list at the bottom of the page. Below are screenshots of what the finished webpage looks like:

I'd like to thank Marni Luka and Jeff Patterson for helping me figure out some of the stylings that I was having trouble with.

I also used the following resources in my journey to complete this project:
